1.4 Palindrome Permutation:
 Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

 For a string to me a Palindrome, if the len(string) is odd the middle term must be a 'mirror'
# If len(string) is even, we must count the same letters duplicate
# Example:
  r a c e c a r
  1 2 3 4 3 2 1
